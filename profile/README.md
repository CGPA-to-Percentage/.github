## What is CGPA?

CGPA stands for Cumulative Grade Point Average. It is a grading system used in many schools, colleges, and universities. It shows a student’s average performance over a period. It is different from percentage grading.

CGPA is given on a scale, usually from 0 to 10. Some universities use a 4-point scale. Indian universities commonly use a 10-point scale.

## Why is CGPA Used?
